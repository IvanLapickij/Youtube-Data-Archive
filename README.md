In the final project I was tasked to build a GUI application which archives & stores data.
Implementing knowledge gotten during classes, with encouragement from lecture to go outside of learning scope. 
Theme & goal of my project is to get data from YouTube and store in Python GUI.

Connectivity
User uses Python GUI which allows retrieve data from text file “links.txt” and see already existing library in application.
Either using provided input user can request data with help off YouTube API 3.
To retrieve data from API, I had to create Google cloud console to use developer key.

Conclusion
Working on this assignment improved my understanding and gave me chance to integrate topics from class in my own project.
The biggest challenge was to follow guidance implementing codes and merging them.
Initially to merge more complex code, programmer should know what it does, so I followed best practices learned from lectures, went through whole code, and simply explain to myself what every line does.
In more complicated functions I left comments for myself & others who going to work on or investigate my code.
